# Fast-Click-Bot
This Python script automates the process of booking tickets for events on the BookMyShow website. It continuously refreshes the page until the "Book" button becomes available and automatically clicks it once found. The script uses Selenium WebDriver with undetected ChromeDriver to avoid detection by automated browsing restrictions.
